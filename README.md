# AlgoVisualizer 🚀

Welcome to AlgoVisualizer! Your fun, interactive playground for understanding complex algorithms. 🎉

## ✨ What's This All About?

Ever felt like algorithms were a bit like magic? 🧙‍♂️ AlgoVisualizer demystifies them by showing you exactly how they work, step-by-step, in a colorful and engaging way. Whether you're a student trying to ace your data structures class, a developer looking to refresh your knowledge, or just a curious mind, this app is for you!

## 🌟 Features

*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Don't just read about algorithms, see them in action!
*   **Step-by-Step Control:** Go at your own pace. Play, pause, and step through the algorithm's execution.
*   **Variety of Algorithms:** (We'll add specific algorithms here as the project grows!)
*   **Responsive Design:** Learn on the go, on any device! (Assuming it's a Flutter app for mobile/web)
*   **Cool Animations & UI:** Because learning should be enjoyable!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Flutter:** For building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
*   **Dart:** The powerful language behind Flutter.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, head over to the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/playboi007/algovisualizer.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd algovisualizer
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
5.  **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

And voila! You should have AlgoVisualizer running on your device/emulator.

    ├── providers/         # State management (e.g., using Provider, Riverpod)
    ├── services/          # Business logic, API calls, etc.
    ├── algorithms/        # Implementations of various algorithms
    └── models/            # Data structures and models
```
